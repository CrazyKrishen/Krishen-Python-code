    "#How it works...\n",
    "#The demoLineEdit.py file is very easy to understand. A class with the name of the top\u0002level object is created, with Ui_ prepended. Since the top-level object used in our\n",
    "#application is Dialog, the Ui_Dialog class is created and stores the interface elements of\n",
    "#our widget. That class has two methods, setupUi() and retranslateUi(). The\n",
    "#setupUi() method sets up the widgets; it creates the widgets that you use while defining\n",
    "#the user interface in Qt Designer. The method creates the widgets one by one and also sets\n",
    "#their properties. The setupUi() method takes a single argument, which is the top-level\n",
    "#widget in which the user interface (child widgets) is created. In our application, it is an\n",
    "#instance of QDialog. The retranslateUi() method translates the interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "#Let's understand what callLineEdit.py does statement-wise:\n",
    "#1. It imports the necessary modules. QWidget is the base class of all user interface objects in PyQt5.\n",
    "\n",
    "#2. It creates a new MyForm class that inherits from the base class, QDialog.\n",
    "\n",
    "#3. It provides the default constructor for QDialog. The default constructor has no parent, and a widget with no parent is known as a window.\n",
    "\n",
    "#4. Event handling in PyQt5 uses signals and slots. A signal is an event, and a slot is\n",
    "#a method that is executed on the occurrence of a signal. For example, when you\n",
    "#click a push button, a clicked() event, also known as a signal, occurs. The\n",
    "#connect() method connects signals with slots. In this case, the slot is a method:\n",
    "#dispmessage(). That is, when the user clicks the push button, the\n",
    "#dispmessage() method will be invoked. clicked() is an event here and an\n",
    "#event handling loop waits for an event to occur and then dispatches it to perform\n",
    "#some task. The event handling loop continues to work until either the exit()\n",
    "#method is called or the main widget is destroyed.\n",
    "\n",
    "#5. It creates an application object with the name app through the QApplication()\n",
    "#method. Every PyQt5 application must create sys.argv application object which\n",
    "#contains a list of arguments from the command line, and it is passed to the\n",
    "#method while creating the application object. The sys.argv parameter helps in\n",
    "#passing and controlling the startup attributes of a script.\n",
    "\n",
    "#6. An instance of the MyForm class is created with the name w.\n",
    "\n",
    "#7. The show() method will display the widget on the screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "#8. The dispmessage() method performs event handling for the push button. It\n",
    "#displays the Hello text, along with the name entered in the Line Edit widget.\n",
    "\n",
    "#9. The sys.exit() method ensures a clean exit, releasing memory resources.\n",
    "#The exec_() method has an underscore because exec is a Python keyword.\n",
